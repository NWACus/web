# Revalidation

Revalidating paths and tags after content changes in order to serve fresh content is a fundamental aspect of Next.js development. Static pages will show old content if we don't invalidate the cache and trigger a rebuild of that content using [ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/incremental-static-regeneration).

When we add new collections and website paths we need to consider the implications on revalidation. Look for "**üßë‚Äçüíª Code to update**" to know where to update things when adding new collections/globals.

[Collection relationship blocks](./decisions/005-collection-relation-blocks.md) complicate revalidation for this codebase because a document may appear in a block embedded on many different paths. We have helpers to identify where a given document appears.

## Architecture Overview

The revalidation system operates on three main principles:

1. **Path-based revalidation** - Using Next.js `revalidatePath()` to invalidate specific routes
2. **Tag-based revalidation** - Using Next.js `revalidateTag()` to invalidate cached data with specific tags
3. **Reference tracking** - Finding all routable collections that reference a changed document through blocks or relationships

## Collection Types

Collections in this system fall into two main categories for revalidation purposes:

### Routable Collections
**Collections that generate frontend routes/paths** and require direct path revalidation:
- Currently: `pages`, `posts`, `homePages`
- Future: Any collection that will have dedicated frontend routes
- Characteristics: Generate URLs (may or may not have slugs), need comprehensive path + reference revalidation

### Reference Collections
**Collections that are referenced by routable collections** but don't have their own frontend routes:
- Examples: `media`, `teams`, `biographies`, `tags`, `forms`
- Characteristics: Only need reference-based revalidation when changed
- When modified, trigger revalidation of routable collections that reference them

## Core Utilities

### `revalidateDocument.ts`
Central function for revalidating routable collections (currently pages, posts, and homePages). Handles:
- Multi-tenant path resolution (`/slug` and `/tenant/slug`)
- Collection-specific URL patterns (e.g., pages use navigation paths, posts use `/blog/slug`, homePages use `/` and `/{center}/`)
- Navigation path discovery for collections that integrate with navigation

**üßë‚Äçüíª Code to update**: This function must be updated when new routable collections are added. Each new routable collection needs its URL pattern logic added here.

### `revalidateBlockReferences.ts`
Finds and revalidates all routable collections that contain a document through content blocks:
- Uses `findDocumentsWithBlockReferences()` to locate referencing documents
- Handles block-based relationships in layouts and content
- Calls `revalidateDocument()` for each found reference

### `revalidateRelationshipReferences.ts`
Finds and revalidates all routable collections that reference a document through relationship fields:
- Uses `findDocumentsWithRelationshipReferences()` to locate referencing documents
- Handles direct relationship field references
- Calls `revalidateDocument()` for each found reference

### Reference Finders

#### `findDocumentsWithBlockReferences.ts`
Queries routable collections for block-based references:
- **Pages**: Searches `layout.{fieldName}` for block references
- **Posts**: Searches `blocksInContent.collection` and `blocksInContent.docId` for embedded blocks
- **HomePages**: Searches `layout.{fieldName}` for block references
- **üßë‚Äçüíª Code to update**: Must be updated when new routable collections are added

#### `findDocumentsWithRelationshipReferences.ts`
Queries routable collections for relationship field references:
- Uses configuration mappings to identify relationship fields
- Searches all routable collections (currently pages, posts, and homePages)
- Only includes published documents (or all documents for homePages which don't have draft status)
- **üßë‚Äçüíª Code to update**: Configuration mappings must include new routable collections

## Collection Patterns

### Routable Collections
Collections that generate frontend routes implement comprehensive revalidation:

#### Pages (`src/collections/Pages/hooks/revalidatePage.ts`)
- **Path revalidation**: Base paths + navigation-discovered paths for both tenant-scoped and global routes
- **Tag revalidation**: `pages-sitemap-{center}`, `navigation-{center}`
- **Previous version handling**: Revalidates old paths when slug changes or status changes
- **Navigation integration**: Discovers additional paths through navigation structure

#### Posts (`src/collections/Posts/hooks/revalidatePost.ts`)
- **Path revalidation**: `/blog/{slug}` and `/{center}/blog/{slug}`
- **Tag revalidation**: `posts-sitemap-{center}`, `navigation-{center}`
- **Reference revalidation**: Calls both `revalidateBlockReferences()` and `revalidateRelationshipReferences()`
- **Previous version handling**: Handles slug changes and status changes

#### HomePages (`src/collections/HomePages/hooks/revalidateHomePage.ts`)
- **Path revalidation**: `/` and `/{center}/` (affects home page routes)
- **Tag revalidation**: `navigation-{center}`
- **Reference revalidation**: Calls both `revalidateBlockReferences()` and `revalidateRelationshipReferences()`
- **Special considerations**: No slugs (affects root paths), no draft status handling needed

### Reference Collections (Media, Teams, Biographies, etc.)
Collections that are referenced by routable collections but don't have their own frontend routes:

#### Media (`src/collections/Media/hooks/revalidateMedia.ts`)
- Only calls `revalidateBlockReferences()` and `revalidateRelationshipReferences()`
- No direct path revalidation (reference collections don't generate routes)

#### Teams, Biographies, Tags
Similar pattern to Media - only reference-based revalidation since they're reference collections.

### Globals
#### NACWidgetsConfig (`src/globals/NACWidgetsConfig/hooks/revalidateWidgetPages.ts`)
- **Path revalidation**: Specific widget-using pages with Next.js page-level revalidation
- **Tag revalidation**: `global_nacWidgetsConfig` for cached global data

## Tracking Blocks in Rich Text Fields

Some collections use Lexical rich text editors that support inline blocks. When blocks in rich text fields reference other collections, those references must be tracked to enable proper revalidation.

### Implementation Pattern

The tracking system consists of three components:

1. **Tracking Field**: A hidden array field that stores block references
2. **Population Hook**: A `beforeChange` hook that extracts block references from the Lexical AST
3. **Query Support**: Updated finder utilities that query the tracking field

### Current Implementations

#### Posts Collection

**Field**: `content` (Lexical richText)
**Tracking Field**: `blocksInContent`

The Posts collection tracks blocks embedded in its main `content` field:

```typescript
{
  name: 'blocksInContent',
  type: 'array',
  admin: {
    readOnly: true,
  },
  fields: [
    { name: 'blockType', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'collection', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'docId', type: 'number' },
  ],
}
```

The `populateBlocksInContent` hook (in `src/collections/Posts/hooks/populateBlocksInContent.ts`) walks the Lexical AST to extract block references and stores them in `blocksInContent` before the document is saved.

#### HomePages Collection

**Field**: `highlightedContent.columns[].richText` (nested Lexical richText)
**Tracking Field**: `blocksInHighlightedContent`

The HomePages collection tracks blocks embedded in the `highlightedContent.columns[].richText` fields:

```typescript
{
  name: 'blocksInHighlightedContent',
  type: 'array',
  admin: {
    readOnly: true,
    description: 'Automatically populated field tracking block references in highlightedContent for revalidation purposes.',
  },
  fields: [
    { name: 'blockType', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'collection', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'docId', type: 'number' },
  ],
}
```

The `populateBlocksInHighlightedContent` hook (in `src/collections/HomePages/hooks/populateBlocksInHighlightedContent.ts`) iterates through all columns and extracts block references from each richText field.

### Adding Block Tracking to New Collections

When adding a new collection with richText fields that support blocks:

1. **Add a tracking field** to the collection schema (similar to `blocksInContent`)
2. **Create a population hook** that:
   - Extracts block references from the Lexical AST
   - Uses `getBlocksFromConfig()` to get block mappings
   - Returns the document with populated tracking field
3. **Update `getBlocksFromConfig.ts`**:
   - Add logic to extract blocks from the new richText field(s)
   - Return new block mappings in the return object
4. **Update `findDocumentsWithBlockReferences.ts`**:
   - Add query logic to search the new tracking field
   - Follow the pattern used for Posts (efficient direct query)

### Example Hook Structure

```typescript
export const populateBlocksInField: CollectionBeforeChangeHook<YourCollection> = async ({
  data,
  req,
}) => {
  let blocksInField: BlockReference[] = []

  if (data.yourRichTextField) {
    try {
      const blockReferences = await extractBlockReferencesFromLexical(data.yourRichTextField)
      blocksInField = blockReferences
    } catch (error) {
      req.payload.logger.warn(`Error extracting block references: ${error}`)
      blocksInField = []
    }
  }

  return {
    ...data,
    blocksInField,
  }
}
```

## Caching Integration

### `unstable_cache` Usage
- **Global data**: `getCachedGlobal()` with tags like `global_{slugName}`
- **Routable collection data**: `getCachedDocument()` with tags like `{collection}_{slug}` (this isn't currently used very much since we need to make query documents based on center + slug typically -- might be a good function to update as we go forward)
- **Navigation data**: Cached with tenant-specific tags

### Tag Naming Conventions
- **Global data**: `global_{globalSlug}`
- **Routable collection data**: `{collection}_{slug}` (again, not used at the moment)
- **Sitemap data**: `{collection}-sitemap-{center}` (for routable collections)
- **Navigation data**: `navigation-{center}`

## Context Controls

### `disableRevalidate` Context
All revalidation hooks respect the `context.disableRevalidate` flag to prevent revalidation during things like:
- Seed script
- Workflow scripts (like `update-media-prefix`)

We should always respect this in new revalidation hooks.

### Autosave Handling
Page and Post hooks skip revalidation when `query.autosave === 'true'` to avoid unnecessary revalidation during draft editing.

## Guidance for Writing Revalidation Functions

### Reference Collections
Collections that don't have frontend routes but are referenced by routable collections:

1. **Only implement reference-based revalidation**:
   ```typescript
   await revalidateBlockReferences({ collection: 'collectionName', id: docId })
   await revalidateRelationshipReferences({ collection: 'collectionName', id: docId })
   ```

2. **No direct path revalidation** (they don't generate routes)

3. **Implement both `afterChange` and `afterDelete` hooks**

### Routable Collections
Collections that generate frontend routes (currently Pages, Posts, HomePages, future collections):

1. **Implement comprehensive path revalidation** for all possible routes
2. **Include tenant-scoped and global paths** in multi-tenant scenarios
3. **Handle collection-specific routing patterns** (e.g., navigation integration, URL prefixes)
4. **Revalidate relevant tags** (sitemaps, navigation, etc.)
5. **Include reference revalidation** if they can be referenced by other routable collections
6. **Handle previous version revalidation** when slugs or status change

### Adding New Routable Collections
When adding a new collection that will have frontend routes:

1. **Update `revalidateDocument.ts`** - Add URL pattern logic for the new collection
2. **Update finder utilities** - Include the new collection in block/relationship reference queries
3. **Create collection-specific revalidation hooks** - Following the routable collection pattern
4. **Update configuration mappings** - Ensure the new collection is included in relationship mappings
5. **Consider navigation integration** - If the collection uses navigation-based routing

### Multi-tenant Considerations
- Always resolve tenant information for proper path construction
- Include both global (`/slug`) and tenant-scoped (`/tenant/slug`) paths. We've experienced bugs related to the path rewriting that happens in `./middleware.ts` if the global path is not also revalidated even if is is not technically a valid path.
- Use tenant-specific cache tags where applicable
- **HomePages example**: Revalidates both `/` (global) and `/{center}/` (tenant-scoped) for home page routes

## Known Limitations

While our revalidation system handles most content changes automatically, there are some scenarios where on-demand revalidation cannot detect all references:

### Deeply Nested RichText Fields in Blocks

**Problem**: Blocks that contain richText fields (richText nested within blocks) are not automatically tracked by the revalidation system.

**Example Scenario**:
- A Page has a `ContentBlock` in its `layout`
- That `ContentBlock` contains a richText field
- The richText field contains a `MediaBlock` that references a media document
- When the media document is updated, the Page won't be automatically revalidated

**Why This Happens**: PayloadCMS field hooks don't fire for blocks within Lexical's BlocksFeature. See: https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/14156

**Workaround**: Time-based revalidation serves as a safety net. Pages are revalidated periodically (every 10-15 minutes) regardless of content changes.

**Possible Solutions** (not currently implemented):
1. Implement async background jobs that scan all routable collection documents for deeply nested relationships
2. Wait for PayloadCMS to add field hook support for Lexical block features

### Impact on Time-Based Revalidation Settings

Because of these limitations, we cannot set very long time-based revalidation periods. Current settings:

- **Individual pages/posts**: 600 seconds (10 minutes) - Conservative safety net for deeply nested blocks
- **Home pages**: 900 seconds (15 minutes) - Longer interval after implementing `highlightedContent` tracking
- **Blog list pages**: 600 seconds (10 minutes) - Not explicitly revalidated when posts change

These shorter intervals ensure that even deeply nested changes appear within a reasonable timeframe, at the cost of more serverless function invocations and CDN cache misses.

### Best Practices

1. **Avoid deeply nesting richText fields** - Keep richText fields at the top level of collections when possible
2. **Implement explicit tracking** - For critical richText fields, follow the pattern in "Tracking Blocks in Rich Text Fields"
3. **Test revalidation behavior** - After adding new blocks or collections, verify that changes trigger proper revalidation
4. **Monitor cache behavior** - Use production builds locally (see README.md) to test ISR behavior

### Testing ISR Locally

To test ISR and caching behavior locally, you need to run a production build:

1. Set `LOCAL_FLAG_ENABLE_LOCAL_PRODUCTION_BUILDS=true` in `.env` to work around a [better-sqlite3 bug](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/issues/1155)
2. Set an appropriate `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN` value (e.g., `localhost:3000`)
3. Run `pnpm build` then `pnpm start`
4. Test content changes and verify revalidation behavior

**Note**: Local production builds may show inconsistent caching behavior (like 404s on `/`) that doesn't occur in actual production environments.

See `.env.example` for all "Local flags" available for debugging and local production builds.

## Misc. notes

Running a production build locally (see: ## Testing ISR / Caching & Production Builds in Local Environment in [README.md](/README.md)) can result in inconsistent caching behavior where revalidating some paths (namely the `/` path) causes 404s locally but works as expected in a production environment.
