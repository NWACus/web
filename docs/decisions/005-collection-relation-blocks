## Context

There are several sections that all ACs will have that will be dynamic based on their organization. These sections will have data that the AC admin(s) will need to populate based on their organization (i.e. staff, sponsors, etc.).

AC admins should be able to:
- control the order of collection entries
- update the underlying data in a single place

We need an approach/pattern for have collection-based data but provide control over content at a block-level that can be different on different pages, in different blocks.

## Decision

Approach: composable [blocks](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/blocks) with relationships to a collection.

These blocks would essentially be a light wrapper on top of the collection, which is the source of the data. Rather than storing data in the actual block, this stores the data in the collection so there can be many blocks referencing the same collection document. An admin could then just update the collection document and each block that references it would also be updated.

Staff as an example:

We could create two collections:
- staff
- staff groups

We could create a few blocks:
- Staff Card (a single staff member's data displayed in a card)
- Staff List (multiple Staff Cards composed together), order is controllable
- Staff Group (multiple Staff Cards composed together), filtered by staff relation to staff groups collection which would be passed a prop to this block via the admin panel

We could enforce that block order is always controlled or include an option in the admin panel to auto populate from the collection using a default sort order. This approach is flexible.

## Consequences

This introduces complexity into page revalidation because updating a collection updates the content on many pages.
