<details>
<summary>Tips for writing good Claude tasks</summary>

**Be specific**: "Add a back-to-top button that appears after scrolling 500px" is better than "Add a button"

**Include acceptance criteria**: Use checkboxes to define what "done" looks like

**One task per issue**: Don't combine unrelated changes

**Provide context**: Link to designs, reference existing similar features
